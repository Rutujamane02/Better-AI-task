# Better-AI-task
Code Analysis Tool
Project Description
This is a web-based tool that allows users to paste or upload code snippets to identify potential performance bottlenecks and receive optimization suggestions. It features a user-friendly interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and a backend powered by Flask. The tool is designed to help developers improve code performance by highlighting inefficiencies.

Features
Analyze code snippets for performance bottlenecks.
Provide suggestions for optimization.
Clipboard functionality to paste code directly into the application.
Simple and intuitive UI for ease of use.
Getting Started
1. Prerequisites
Before running this project, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

Python (>= 3.7)
Flask (pip install flask)
Flask-CORS (pip install flask-cors)
2. Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/code-analysis-tool.git
cd code-analysis-tool
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install flask flask-cors
3. Running the Application
Start the Flask server:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
This will start the backend at http://127.0.0.1:5000.

Open index.html in your browser:

Navigate to the frontend directory.
Open index.html using your browser.
Paste or upload a code snippet and click Analyze Code to see the results.

Design Choices
Backend:
Framework: Flask
Chosen for its simplicity and efficiency in building lightweight REST APIs.
CORS Enabled: Allows frontend and backend to communicate without browser restrictions.
Code Analysis Logic: Basic string-based analysis to detect nested loops and inefficient constructs.
Frontend:
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:
Provides a responsive and minimalistic interface.
Includes a textarea for code input, buttons for analysis, and real-time output display.
Clipboard Integration:
Allows users to paste code directly into the textarea.
Assumptions and Limitations
Assumptions:
The code snippets provided are small and can be processed synchronously.
The user provides Python code for analysis (other languages are not yet supported).
Limitations:
Limited to identifying simple bottlenecks (e.g., nested loops, inefficient sorting).
No support for advanced static analysis or dynamic runtime profiling.
May not handle non-Python code effectively.

# Sample Python code with a performance bottleneck
def find_duplicate_numbers(numbers):
    duplicates = []
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)):
            if numbers[i] == numbers[j] and numbers[i] not in duplicates:
                duplicates.append(numbers[i])
    return duplicates

# Test the function
numbers_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 2]
print(find_duplicate_numbers(numbers_list))
